-What this is my very own cryptocurrency. That simple. It allows a person to go and create an account, transfer the Beyondverse coin, see the transactions in the blockchain and get rewarded with Beyondverse coin by mining blocks.

##Implementation
- Checkout blockchain.py inside the BeyondVerse folder to see implementation
- "pip install" all the dependencies in by executing 'python run.py'.
- It should continue to tell you the module that needs to installed each time you try to run it.
- Once Everything is installed, open two terminals to run run.py and run2.py seperately.
